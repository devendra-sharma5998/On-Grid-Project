        "Question 1":'What is background verification (BGV)?',
        "Answer":'Background verification (BGV), also referred to as Background check (BGC) or background screening is a process that validates the credentials claimed by an individual going through the BGV process. The individual can be an employee, contractor, user, loan applicant, merchant, or a candidate requesting to access any product or service. The BGV process is a combination of checks, and the organization requesting BGV generally selects the list of checks. Some common checks include identity verification, address verification, criminal record check, prior employment verification, highest education verification, professional reference checks, credit history checks, etc.'

        "Question 2":"What is the potential impact of not doing background verification?",
        "Answer":"Not running background checks can lead to various risks for an organization such as ending up with a bad hire, non-compliance to ISO requirements, organization brand value, and reputational risk, safety risks, as well as financial liability risks. In context of employment, not doing Background verification (BGV) can lead to induction of a wrong hire (or a hire with a malicious past), that can in turn adversely impact the team culture, or even result in modern-day threats related to data security.According to a 2014 survey, a wrong hire can single-handedly bring down the team productivity by 15% and can cause negative financial impact accounting for 10 times the cost to the company (CTC)."
